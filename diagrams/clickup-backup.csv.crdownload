258w010,"Organizing with the Hierarchy"," \n\nWorkspace\nYour Workspace¬†is the top level. You can join or create as many Workspaces as you like - and easily switch between them in ClickUp.¬†\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:¬†Each ClickUp Workspace is¬†entirely separate, so it is not possible to view or transfer information between them.¬†This is why most people prefer to keep everything all in one Workspace!\nSpaces\nSpaces are the second level, they divide your Workspace up into big chunks and can each be customized to work differently. You can easily switch between Spaces, move tasks between them, and view tasks from multiple Spaces at the same time.\nFolders & Lists\nThe sidebar also shows Folder and Lists. Basically, Folders group and organize your Lists, and Lists contain tasks. Each Folder or List can be customized to have a different workflow (or not).\n\nWhile Lists do not have to be located within a Folder, every Task in ClickUp¬†must¬†be located within a List. \nTasks\nLastly, this brings us to tasks. Tasks have the features that are turned on in their Space, and the workflow set by their List (which could just be inheriting it from the Folder/Space). You can change where a task is located at any time, but if you want to change workflow settings (like Statuses, or Custom Fields) then you'll need to change them for the whole Space, Folder, or List.¬†\n\nAssigned Comments\nAssigned Comments occur within tasks and List info. They work as action items that will notify an assigned user that a he our she is responsible for resolving a comment. Assigned comments provide a fool-proof way to never lose track of a task, as they will remain visible until resolved.\n \nSubtasks\nAnd of course, Subtasks are within parent tasks. A subtask carries the same traits as the parent task and Space that it is in. If your Space has Statuses and multiple assignees, your subtasks will as well.¬†\n\nChecklists\nChecklists are essentially simple, nested to-do item lists. Checklist items have the simplest statuses (either done or not done), and can easily be dragged and dropped between checklists.\n",Open,1648306767081,"3/26/2022, 9:59:27 AM CDT",,"",,"",null,"[{""title"":""image.png"",""url"":""https://t1281268.p.clickup-attachments.com/t1281268/9780fba5-2ac1-48bd-bda0-787334cdad43/image.png""}]","[Ageless Partners]","[]",3,"Get Started Here!

258vjtq,"Organizing with the Hierarchy"," \n\nWorkspace\nYour Workspace¬†is the top level. You can join or create as many Workspaces as you like - and easily switch between them in ClickUp.¬†\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:¬†Each ClickUp Workspace is¬†entirely separate, so it is not possible to view or transfer information between them.¬†This is why most people prefer to keep everything all in one Workspace!\nSpaces\nSpaces are the second level, they divide your Workspace up into big chunks and can each be customized to work differently. You can easily switch between Spaces, move tasks between them, and view tasks from multiple Spaces at the same time.\nFolders & Lists\nThe sidebar also shows Folder and Lists. Basically, Folders group and organize your Lists, and Lists contain tasks. Each Folder or List can be customized to have a different workflow (or not).\n\nWhile Lists do not have to be located within a Folder, every Task in ClickUp¬†must¬†be located within a List. \nTasks\nLastly, this brings us to tasks. Tasks have the features that are turned on in their Space, and the workflow set by their List (which could just be inheriting it from the Folder/Space). You can change where a task is located at any time, but if you want to change workflow settings (like Statuses, or Custom Fields) then you'll need to change them for the whole Space, Folder, or List.¬†\n\nAssigned Comments\nAssigned Comments occur within tasks and List info. They work as action items that will notify an assigned user that a he our she is responsible for resolving a comment. Assigned comments provide a fool-proof way to never lose track of a task, as they will remain visible until resolved.\n \nSubtasks\nAnd of course, Subtasks are within parent tasks. A subtask carries the same traits as the parent task and Space that it is in. If your Space has Statuses and multiple assignees, your subtasks will as well.¬†\n\nChecklists\nChecklists are essentially simple, nested to-do item lists. Checklist items have the simplest statuses (either done or not done), and can easily be dragged and dropped between checklists.\n",Open,1648280973015,"3/26/2022, 2:49:33 AM CDT",,"",,"",null,"[{""title"":""image.png"",""url"":""https://t1281268.p.clickup-attachments.com/t1281268/9780fba5-2ac1-48bd-bda0-787334cdad43/image.png""}]","[Edward Kerstein]","[]",3,"Get Started Here!

2mcvkbp,"Organizing with the Hierarchy"," \n\nWorkspace\nYour Workspace¬†is the top level. You can join or create as many Workspaces as you like - and easily switch between them in ClickUp.¬†\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:¬†Each ClickUp Workspace is¬†entirely separate, so it is not possible to view or transfer information between them.¬†This is why most people prefer to keep everything all in one Workspace!\nSpaces\nSpaces are the second level, they divide your Workspace up into big chunks and can each be customized to work differently. You can easily switch between Spaces, move tasks between them, and view tasks from multiple Spaces at the same time.\nFolders & Lists\nThe sidebar also shows Folder and Lists. Basically, Folders group and organize your Lists, and Lists contain tasks. Each Folder or List can be customized to have a different workflow (or not).\n\nWhile Lists do not have to be located within a Folder, every Task in ClickUp¬†must¬†be located within a List. \nTasks\nLastly, this brings us to tasks. Tasks have the features that are turned on in their Space, and the workflow set by their List (which could just be inheriting it from the Folder/Space). You can change where a task is located at any time, but if you want to change workflow settings (like Statuses, or Custom Fields) then you'll need to change them for the whole Space, Folder, or List.¬†\n\nAssigned Comments\nAssigned Comments occur within tasks and List info. They work as action items that will notify an assigned user that a he our she is responsible for resolving a comment. Assigned comments provide a fool-proof way to never lose track of a task, as they will remain visible until resolved.\n \nSubtasks\nAnd of course, Subtasks are within parent tasks. A subtask carries the same traits as the parent task and Space that it is in. If your Space has Statuses and multiple assignees, your subtasks will as well.¬†\n\nChecklists\nChecklists are essentially simple, nested to-do item lists. Checklist items have the simplest statuses (either done or not done), and can easily be dragged and dropped between chec
